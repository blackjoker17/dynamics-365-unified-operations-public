# Retail Modern POS triggers and printing

You can use triggers to capture events that occur before or after Retail Modern POS operations. Using triggers supports several business logic scenarios that enable you to do the following: 
- Insert custom logic before the operation runs or after it has completed. This includes operation-specific triggers and generic triggers called the PreOperationTrigger and PostOperationTrigger, which run at the beginning and end of all POS operations.  
- Continue or cancel an operation. For example, if your validation fails or returns an error, then you can cancel the operation in pre-trigger. Post-triggers are not cancelable. 
- Use the post-trigger for scenarios where you want to show custom messages or insert custom fields after the standard logic is performed. 

This topic applies to Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition and Dynamics 365 for Retail with Platform update 8 and Retail Application update 4 hotfix. 

The following table lists the available triggers and denotes whether they can be cancelled.

## How to implement a trigger

In this example, a custom receipt is printed when the user suspends a transaction. This example implements the **PostSuspendTransactionTrigger** trigger and prints the custom receipt using the existing print peripheral API.

1.  Open Visual Studio 2015 in administrator mode.
2.  Open the **ModernPOS** solution from **…\RetailSDK\POS**.
3.  Under the **POS.Extensions** project, create a new folder named **SuspendReceiptSample**.
4.  Under **SuspendReceiptSample**, create new folder named **TriggersHandlers**.
5.  In the **TriggersHandlers** folder, add a new Typescript file named **PostSuspendTransactionTrigger.ts**.
6.  Add the following **import** statements to import the relevant entities and context.
    ```typescript
    import * as Triggers from "PosApi/Extend/Triggers/TransactionTriggers";
    import { ObjectExtensions } from "PosApi/TypeExtensions";
    import { ClientEntities, ProxyEntities } from "PosApi/Entities";
    import { PrinterPrintRequest, PrinterPrintResponse } from "PosApi/Consume/Peripherals";
    import { GetHardwareProfileClientRequest, GetHardwareProfileClientResponse } from "PosApi/Consume/Device";
    import { GetReceiptsClientRequest, GetReceiptsClientResponse } from "PosApi/Consume/SalesOrders";
    ```
7. Create a new class named **PostSuspendTransactionTrigger** and extend it from **PostSuspendTransactionTrigger**.
    ```typescript
    export default class PostSuspendTransactionTrigger extends Triggers.PostSuspendTransactionTrigger { }
    ```
8. Implement the trigger's **execute** method to get the receipt profile and print the custom receipt:
    ```typescript
    public execute(options: Triggers.IPostSuspendTransactionTriggerOptions): Promise < void> {
        this.context.logger.logVerbose("Executing PostSuspendTransactionTrigger with options " + JSON.stringify(options) + ".");
        if(ObjectExtensions.isNullOrUndefined(options) || ObjectExtensions.isNullOrUndefined(options.cart)) {
            // This will never happen, but is included to demonstrate how to return a rejected promise when validation fails.
            let error: ClientEntities.ExtensionError
                = new ClientEntities.ExtensionError("The options provided to the PostSuspendTransactionTrigger were invalid.");
            return Promise.reject(error);
        } else {
            return this.context.runtime.executeAsync(new GetHardwareProfileClientRequest())
                .then((response: ClientEntities.ICancelableDataResult<GetHardwareProfileClientResponse>)
                    : Promise<ClientEntities.ICancelableDataResult<GetReceiptsClientResponse>> => {
                    let hardwareProfile: ProxyEntities.HardwareProfile = response.data.result;
                    // Gets the receipts.
                    let salesOrderId: string = options.cart.Id;
                    let receiptRetrievalCriteria: ProxyEntities.ReceiptRetrievalCriteria = {
                        IsCopy: false,
                        IsRemoteTransaction: false,
                        IsPreview: false,
                        QueryBySalesId: true,
                        ReceiptTypeValue: ProxyEntities.ReceiptType.CustomReceipt7,
                        HardwareProfileId: hardwareProfile.ProfileId
                    };
                    let getReceiptsClientRequest: GetReceiptsClientRequest<GetReceiptsClientResponse> =
                        new GetReceiptsClientRequest(salesOrderId, receiptRetrievalCriteria);
                    return this.context.runtime.executeAsync(getReceiptsClientRequest);
                })
                .then((response: ClientEntities.ICancelableDataResult<GetReceiptsClientResponse>)
                    : Promise<ClientEntities.ICancelableDataResult<PrinterPrintResponse>> => {
                    let receipts: ProxyEntities.Receipt[] = response.data.result;
                    // Prints the receipts.
                    let printerPrintRequest: PrinterPrintRequest<PrinterPrintResponse> = new PrinterPrintRequest(receipts);
                    return this.context.runtime.executeAsync(printerPrintRequest);
                }).then((): Promise<void> => {
                    // Resolves to a void result when fulfilled.
                    return Promise.resolve();
                }).catch((reason: any): Promise<void> => {
                    // Resolves to a void result when rejected. This matches existing POS printing behavior.
                    this.context.logger.logError("PostSuspendTransactionTrigger execute error: " + JSON.stringify(reason));
                    return Promise.resolve();
                });
        }
    }
    ```
    The entire example should look like the following.
    ```typescript
    import * as Triggers from "PosApi/Extend/Triggers/TransactionTriggers";
    import { ObjectExtensions } from "PosApi/TypeExtensions";
    import { ClientEntities, ProxyEntities } from "PosApi/Entities";
    import { PrinterPrintRequest, PrinterPrintResponse } from "PosApi/Consume/Peripherals";
    import { GetHardwareProfileClientRequest, GetHardwareProfileClientResponse } from "PosApi/Consume/Device";
    import { GetReceiptsClientRequest, GetReceiptsClientResponse } from "PosApi/Consume/SalesOrders";
    export default class PostSuspendTransactionTrigger extends Triggers.PostSuspendTransactionTrigger {
        /**
        * Executes the trigger functionality.
        * @param {Triggers.IPostSuspendTransactionTriggerOptions} options The options provided to the trigger.
        */
        public execute(options: Triggers.IPostSuspendTransactionTriggerOptions): Promise<void> {
            this.context.logger.logVerbose("Executing PostSuspendTransactionTrigger with options " + JSON.stringify(options) + ".");
            if (ObjectExtensions.isNullOrUndefined(options) || ObjectExtensions.isNullOrUndefined(options.cart)) {
                // This will never happen, but is included to demonstrate how to return a rejected promise when validation fails.
                let error: ClientEntities.ExtensionError
                    = new ClientEntities.ExtensionError("The options provided to the PostSuspendTransactionTrigger were invalid.");
                return Promise.reject(error);
            } else {
                return this.context.runtime.executeAsync(new GetHardwareProfileClientRequest())
                    .then((response: ClientEntities.ICancelableDataResult<GetHardwareProfileClientResponse>)
                        : Promise<ClientEntities.ICancelableDataResult<GetReceiptsClientResponse>> => {
                        let hardwareProfile: ProxyEntities.HardwareProfile = response.data.result;
                        // Gets the receipts.
                        let salesOrderId: string = options.cart.Id;
                        let receiptRetrievalCriteria: ProxyEntities.ReceiptRetrievalCriteria = {
                            IsCopy: false,
                            IsRemoteTransaction: false,
                            IsPreview: false,
                            QueryBySalesId: true,
                            ReceiptTypeValue: ProxyEntities.ReceiptType.CustomReceipt7,
                            HardwareProfileId: hardwareProfile.ProfileId
                        };
                        let getReceiptsClientRequest: GetReceiptsClientRequest<GetReceiptsClientResponse> =
                            new GetReceiptsClientRequest(salesOrderId, receiptRetrievalCriteria);
                        return this.context.runtime.executeAsync(getReceiptsClientRequest);
                    })
                    .then((response: ClientEntities.ICancelableDataResult<GetReceiptsClientResponse>)
                        : Promise<ClientEntities.ICancelableDataResult<PrinterPrintResponse>> => {
                        let receipts: ProxyEntities.Receipt[] = response.data.result;
                        // Prints the receipts.
                        let printerPrintRequest: PrinterPrintRequest<PrinterPrintResponse> = new PrinterPrintRequest(receipts);
                        return this.context.runtime.executeAsync(printerPrintRequest);
                    }).then((): Promise<void> => {
                        // Resolves to a void result when fulfilled.
                        return Promise.resolve();
                    }).catch((reason: any): Promise<void> => {
                        // Resolves to a void result when rejected. This matches existing POS printing behavior.
                        this.context.logger.logError("PostSuspendTransactionTrigger execute error: " + JSON.stringify(reason));

                        "minimumPosVersion": "7.2.0.0",
                            "components": {
            "extend": {
                "triggers": [
                    {
                        "triggerType": "PostSuspendTransaction",
                        "modulePath": "TriggersHandlers/PostSuspendTransactionTrigger"
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
    ```
11. Open the **extensions.json** file in the **POS.Extensions** project and update it with the **SuspendReceiptSample** samples, so that during runtime POS will include this extension.
    ```typescript
    {
        "extensionPackages": [
            {
                "baseUrl": "SampleExtensions2"
            },
            {
                "baseUrl": "SuspendReceiptSample"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
12. Open the **tsconfig.json** file and comment out the extension package folders from the exclude list. POS will use this file to include or exclude the extension. By default, the list contains all the excluded extensions list. If you want to include an extension that is part of the POS, then add the extension folder name and comment out the extension from the extension, as shown.
    ```typescript
    "exclude": [
        "AuditEventExtensionSample",
        "B2BSample",
        "CustomerSearchWithAttributesSample",
        "FiscalRegisterSample",
        "PaymentSample",
        "PromotionsSample",
        "SalesTransactionSignatureSample",
        "SampleExtensions",
        //"SampleExtensions2",
        "StoreHoursSample",
        "SuspendTransactionReceiptSample"
        //"POSAPIExtension",
        //"CustomColumnExtensions",
        //"EODSample",
        //"ProdDetailsCustomColumnExtensions",
        //"SerachExtension",
        //"SuspendReceiptSample"
    ],
    ```
13. Compile and rebuild the project.
